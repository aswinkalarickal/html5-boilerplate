## HTML5 Boilerplate

This boilerplate was designed to serve as base for Front-End Development using Bower, Grunt, Bootstrap and Sass.

## Getting Started

To install the Grunt packages run the following command in terminal:
```bash
npm install
```

To install the Bower packages run the following command in terminal:
```bash
bower install
```

To sever the website locally run the following command in terminal:
```bash
grunt serve
```
This will start a local server running at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with **livereload**. It will watch for changes in `html, scss, js and image files` in the `app` folder and reloads the browser if any. I will also build `src/css/style.css` upon changing any of the **SASS** files.

To build the distribution package run the following command in terminal:
```bash
grunt build
```

The distribution package will be built to `dist` folder.
